# Clamp to attach a pen (drawing tool) to a CNC router
3d model of a clamp to attach a pen to a router for drawing with a CNC

This is inspired by the Shapeoko Quick Draw CNC Pen Holder https://shop.carbide3d.com/collections/accessories/products/quickdraw. The normal V shaped base works well for most drawing implements, but I wanted something that would allow for custom attachments for angled drawing tools to still vertically align.

I use a version of the parametric clamp listed here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31982#google_vignette
